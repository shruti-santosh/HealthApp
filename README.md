## HealthApp
Really glad to say that my first endevour with Kotlin was somewhat successful because of MLH and [Sashrika](https://github.com/sashrikakaur)...

#what it is ❓
an app that counts our number of steps

#what does it use ❓
our phone's sensors 

#what could be better ❓
i tried to add an image that would make the app look better as an attempt to improvise something but of course it kept throwing errors at me and kept crashing so i kept it in it's primitve working form.

thanks for reading hehe.
